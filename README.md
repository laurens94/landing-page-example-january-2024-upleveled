# Cloned landing page January 2024

This repo is a reference for the lecture I gave for [UpLeveled](https://upleveled.io/).

During this practical lecture we cloned a few sections of the landingpage https://www.enterpret.com in React, utilizing CSS Modules and tackling some common CSS layout problems.

## Run locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
